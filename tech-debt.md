* I haven't been updating the CHANGELOG since I forked this from the A6A project. ~~cjw
* I am not so good at writing phpspec specs. They are sparse. ~~cjw
* I added in an SSRV token to the login session. Same Site Request Validation token cf. cross site request forgery token. I didn't take time to add any tests. It's included on form submissions to make sure the session generated the form submitted by the session. ~~cjw
